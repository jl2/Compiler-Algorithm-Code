Implementations of some algorithms from Chapter 3 of the book 
"Compilers: Principles, Techniques, & Tools"

Specifically:
  Converts a regular expression into a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA)
  Tests whether an NFA accepts a string
  Converts an NFA into a deterministic finite automaton (DFA)
  Tests whether a DFA accepts a string
  Converts an NFA or DFA into a format that can be visualized with the GraphViz tool dot

At some point I may add code for other algorithms from the book.

I'm currently in the process of porting the code from Haskell to Python.

Testing a commit/push.
